# lexicon

Command Line Tool to help you expand your vocabulary and familiarize you with those elusive words.


## Installation

Since the package is not yet mature enough for distribution through PyPI, you will have to install it manually.

**Step 01**: Clone this repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/kshitij10496/familiarize.git`

**Step 02**: Change to the package folder: `$ cd familiarize`

**Step 03**: Install the dependencies: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Step 04**: Install the package: `$ python3 setup.py install`

**NOTE**: The project is under heavy development and the code has been tested manually.  
So, I won't be surprised if things break unexpectedly. Do report them as issues.  
The most common issue that you might face currently would be *connection timeouts*.  
As an ad-hoc bypass for the problem, re-run the previous command.
